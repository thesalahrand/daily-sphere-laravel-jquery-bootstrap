      <p class="card-text"><b>Daily Sphere</b> is <b>Mohammad Salah</b>'s primary open source project which he was
        thinking to build for at least a year. Its vision is to keep track of your daily necessary activities in an
        effective and eloquent way. The founder of this project believes, <i>"Keep tracking of a thing puts extra
          emphasis into that particular thing".</i> That philosophy has compelled him to start building that project.
        <b>Mohammad Salah</b> aims to keep adding more and more features into this project regularly as well as
        implements the best practices he learns of the associated technologies.

      <p class="card-text">As you have already noticed, we do not store any of your personal information such as phone,
        email or address etc. We force you to use a pseudo name. Another thing is that on the leaderboard page, your
        pseudo name is not even mentioned. Therefore, you can be totally sure that your actual identity is never
        compromised.</p>
